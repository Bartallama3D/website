Hi there! My name is Bart and I am the creator of Bartallama3D. As an engineer by trade, I enjoy 3D printing to solve problems and build cool stuff!
Using 3D printing I have built cool projects for my home, various brackets, and even some fun toys for my friends as gifts. 

If you would like to get in touch with me, you can email me at [hello@bartallama3d.design](mailto:hello@bartallam3d.design)

### My story

I had always wanted to start my own business and create products. After purchasing my first home, I found that a lot of products that I wanted 
sometimes did not exist or were very expensive. This is when I decided to try out 3D printing and got my first 3D printer from a friend. 

I quickly fell in love with 3D printing and purchased my own printer. Using this printer I was able to create all sorts of brackets, jigs, and custom
3D printed items for my house. My largest project to date was desiging some smart home shades that fit my custom specifications. 
All of the shades on the market were either very basic (RF control, vendor specific remote, low variety in fabric choices/design) or were extremely expensive. 
I set out to build my own smart home shades
that fit my needs (dual shade, blackout shade in the back sheer in the front, Z-Wave connectivity, Hard-Wired, Fabric colors I liked). I was able to 
achieve this mostly using DIY shade materials, tubular motors I found on AliExpress, and custom 3D printed parts. 

Since then, I have continued using 3D printing to solve problems around my house and in my life. My goal with the Bartallama3D project is to design, print, and sell
items that don't exist on the market today. The goal will always be functionality and aesthetics while also trying to create as little plastic waste 
as possible.
