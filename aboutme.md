Hi there! My name is Bart and I am the creator of Bartallama3D. As an engineer by trade, I enjoy 3D printing to solve problems and build cool stuff!
Using 3D printing I have built cool projects for my home, various brackets, and even some fun toys for my friends as gifts. 

If you would like to get in touch with me, you can email me at [hello@bartallama3d.design](mailto:hello@bartallama3d.design)

### My story

I had always wanted to start my own business and create products. After purchasing my first home, I found that a lot of products that I wanted 
sometimes did not exist or were very expensive. This is when I decided to try out 3D printing and got my first 3D printer from a friend. 

I quickly fell in love with 3D printing and purchased my own printer. Using this printer I was able to create all sorts of brackets, jigs, and custom
3D printed items for my house. My largest project to date was desiging some smart home shades that fit my custom specifications. 
All of the shades on the market were either very basic (RF control, vendor specific remote, low variety in fabric choices/design) or were extremely expensive. 
I set out to build my own smart home shades
that fit my needs (dual shade, blackout shade in the back sheer in the front, Z-Wave connectivity, Hard-Wired, Fabric colors I liked). I was able to 
achieve this mostly using DIY shade materials, tubular motors I found on AliExpress, and custom 3D printed parts. 

Since then, I have continued using 3D printing to solve problems around my house and in my life. My goal with the Bartallama3D project is to design, print, and sell
items that don't exist on the market today. The goal will always be functionality and aesthetics while also trying to create as little plastic waste 
as possible.

### Stop the Print: Washington's Impossible "Firearms Detection Algorithm" Mandate

Washington State has introduced House Bill 2321 as part of the 2026 legislative session, which would require all 3D printers sold in the state to include software that detects and blocks the printing of firearms or firearm components using a "firearms blueprint detection algorithm." We submitted comments to the Washington State House Committee on Civil Rights & Judiciary voicing our concerns, mainly:

1. **The required detection technology is technically infeasible** — No algorithm can reliably distinguish a firearm receiver from a power drill handle based on geometry alone, and the bill's requirement to detect "modified versions" of files is computationally impossible.
2. **The bill creates Prop 65-style compliance theater** — Overly broad detection will block legitimate prints while bad actors simply use older printers or modified firmware.
3. **Economic harm through market withdrawal** — Manufacturers face felony liability for non-compliance with impossible requirements, incentivizing them to exit Washington entirely or lock down open-source ecosystems.
4. **Cybersecurity and trade secret conflicts** — Businesses under ITAR or with proprietary designs cannot send files to government databases for pre-approval.
5. **The penalty structure is backwards** — Selling a 3D printer without detection software carries harsher penalties than possessing an actual untraceable firearm.
