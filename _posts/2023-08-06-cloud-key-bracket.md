Introducing our 3D printed Unifi Cloud Key G2 Plus 1U Bracket. This bracket allows you to mount your Cloud Key in a rack. The brackets supports mounting on either the left or right side of the rack. The bracket is designed to be tight around your cloud key but also has both the top and bottom open to allow for open air cooling of the device.

This bracket was particularly fun to design since I was looking for something sleek that also allows for the top and bottom to be cooled properly. Check out the product development content shared on Instagram to see the design iterations before this final one.
