Introducing our 3D printed Valentine One V1Gen1 mounting bracket for Teslas. I had been looking online for a way to install my Valentine One Radar Detector in my Tesla and could not find a nice solution to this problem. There were some recommendations and videos online that showed you how to mount it, but those turned out to fail over time since they were not designed to hold the radar in place. This mount is specifically designed to hold on to your Valentine One Radar and mount it directly above your center display screen in your Tesla. 

The mount was tested in a Tesla Model Y with a Valentine One V1Gen1 unit. It should be compatible with other Teslas but is not confirmed compatible with the Valentine One V1Gen2. We have more in store for this item so check back soon to see what other accessories we come up with for the Valentine One ecosystem.
