# Privacy Policy

Effective date: March 5th, 2024

Bartallama3D ("us", "we", or "our") operates the https://www.bartallama3d.design website (the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

## Information Collection And Use

We do not collect any personal information on our website. If you make a purchase from us through one of our online stores (Amazon, Etsy, eBay), we recommend referring to their respective privacy policies to understand how they handle your information. Additionally, we host our website on GitHub pages, you can view their privacy policy to understand how they process your data and any records they may retain. 

[Amazon Privacy Policy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GX7NJQ4ZB8MHFRNJ&ref_=footer_privacy)<br/>
[Ebay Privacy Policy](https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-privacy-notice-privacy-policy?id=4260)<br/>

## Information Use

Any information collected is for the purposes of order fulfillment and business reporting. Your name, mailing country, state, city, and zip code are retained for our business records. In the future, anonymized zip codes may be used to show where our products have been shipped in the US. An anonymized zip code will be the first 3 digits of your full 5 digit zip code (example: 12345 would become 12300). No identifiable information will ever be shared in this process.

## Information Sharing

Your mailing address is shared with our shipping partners for the purpose of creating shipping labels. Those partners in turn share your address with shipping providers such as USPS, UPS, FedEx, and DHL.

## Data Retention

Records of sales are retained indefinitely. Street mailing addresses are retained only until your order is fulfilled.

## Cookies

We do not use cookies on our website. Our hosting partner, Github, may collect information, and their privacy policy can be found at [placeholder].

## Your Rights

If you would like your personal data wiped from our records (first + last name, country, city, state, zip-code), you can request for us to remove this. By doing this, you forfeit the ability for us to provide post-sale support and warranty services where applicable.

## Opt-out

Send us an email to hello@bartallama3d.design with your order information, and we will remove your personal information from our records. We will only retain the product that you purchased along with the unique order number from the platform you made your purchase on.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

Privacy policy updates will be posted to this page with the date updated at the top of the page.
