# Printed Product Goals

When printing our products, our goal is always an aesthetically pleasing product. There are situations where we may print a product out
and it does not meet our high standards. We are currently exploring alternate avenues to offer products that have slight imperfections/blemishes
at reduced cost. Those products will always still be functional. 

For some products, like our ceiling camera mounts, if an imperfection is found on the inside that will not be visible post installation and that imperfection
does not affect the functionality of the product,  we will allow that imperfection into our production batch since it does not affect the final installed product.
