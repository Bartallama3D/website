# Reclaimed Products Program (RPP)
The Reclaimed Products Program (RPP) is an initiative that aims to reduce waste and offer discounted 3D printed items to customers. RPP products are slightly imperfect, with minor cosmetic flaws or printing inaccuracies, but they are fully functional and undergo thorough scrutiny before being offered for sale. These items will be sold exclusively on eBay at a 20% discount off retail prices, providing customers with quality products at a reduced price.

## Program Goals

Reduce Waste: By repurposing slightly imperfect 3D printed items, we aim to minimize waste and contribute to a more sustainable manufacturing process.
Offer Value: Provide customers with an opportunity to purchase high-quality items at a discounted price.
Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Ensure that all RPP products meet our quality standards and provide customers with products that are fully functional and satisfactory.

## Product Selection Process

Inspection: All items considered for the RPP undergo a thorough inspection process to identify minor imperfections.
Quality Assurance: Despite minor flaws, all RPP products are fully functional and meet our quality standards.
Exclusivity: Only items with minor cosmetic flaws or printing inaccuracies are selected for the RPP, ensuring that customers receive unique products at a discounted price.

## Sales and Distribution

Exclusive eBay Store: RPP products will be sold exclusively through our eBay store, providing a dedicated platform for customers to purchase these items.
Discounted Pricing: RPP items will be priced at a 20% discount off the retail price, offering customers an attractive deal on quality products.
Limited Availability: Due to the nature of the program, RPP items will be available in limited quantities with no planned stock or re-stock frequencies (stock becomes available only when prints fail)

## Customer Experience

Transparency: Product listings on eBay will clearly indicate that the item is part of the RPP, and photos of example product imperfections will be included. 
Customer Support: Our customer support team is available to address any questions or concerns regarding RPP products, ensuring a positive shopping experience.

The Reclaimed Products Program (RPP) reflects our commitment to sustainability and customer satisfaction. By offering slightly imperfect 3D printed items at a discounted price, we aim to reduce waste, provide value to our customers, and offer unique products that are both functional and affordable. We invite you to explore our eBay store and discover the exclusive deals available through the RPP.
