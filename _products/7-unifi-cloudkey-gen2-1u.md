Introducing our 3D printed Unifi Cloud Key G2 Plus 1U Bracket. This bracket allows you to mount your Cloud Key in a standard server rack. The brackets supports mounting on either the left or right side of the rack and takes up only 1U (1.75inches) inches of vertical space in your rack. The bracket is designed to be tight around your cloud key but also has both the top and bottom open to allow for open air cooling of the device.  

\* Listing is for only the 3D Printed bracket. Cloud Key is not included. Mounting hardware for your rack is also not included. 

\*\* The pictured color for this mount is Dark Gray. This listing is for the bracket printed in Black. If you'd like to get a custom color, other than black, please reach out and we can custom print another color if we have it in stock.
