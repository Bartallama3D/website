revisions:

    change_log: Initial release of the bracket. Packed in plastic bags.

  - version: 1.2
    change_log: Added Rubber pads to the units, replacing the previous 3M tape. This now makes the units easily removable while still providing the same grip.
  - version: 1.3
    change_log: Replaced the fat mounting platform with the newer Slim platform found on most other radars. This enhances the aesthetic on the Tesla screen and makes the entire radar looker smaller/slimmer. 
  - version: 1.4
    change_log: Newer sturdier packaging and printed color inserts. Valentine One 1st generation holder has been changed to an Insert/Glove type holder from a tray type holder making the part stronger. The part also has light texture applied to surface to enhance visual appeal, features a satisfying click when inserting the radar unit into the holder, and also supports rotation up to 30 degrees in either direction to support Model S/X vehicles along with custom modded screens that have a tilt attachment added.
