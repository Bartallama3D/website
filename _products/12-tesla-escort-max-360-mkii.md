revisions:
  - version: 1.0
    change_log: Initial release of the holder
  - version: 1.1
    change_log: Replacing the 3M tape with Rubber pads. This now makes the unit easily removable while still providing the same great grip.
  - version: 1.2
    change_log: Unit now comes with a slim platform found on some newer radar units. Makes the entire unit look smaller and more aesthetically pleasing.
  - version: 1.3
    change_log: Newer sturdier packaging and printed color inserts. Parts shipped are unchanged from version 1.2. 
  - version: 1.4
    change_log: Newer sturdier packaging and printed color inserts. Escort Max 360c holder has been changed to an Insert/Glove type holder from a tray type holder making the part stronger. The part also has light texture applied to surface to enhance visual appeal, features a satisfying click when inserting the radar unit into the holder, and also supports rotation up to 30 degrees in either direction to support Model S/X vehicles along with custom modded screens that have a tilt attachment added.
  - version: 1.5
    change_log: New adjustable platform allows for upward/downward adjustment of the entire radar unit. This should alleviate issues with Tesla screens with varying pitches and fully make this unit compatible with the model S/X. This also allows customers to adjust the upward/downward angle of the radar unit as they see fit.
