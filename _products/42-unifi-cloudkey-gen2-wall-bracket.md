Introducing our 3D printed Unifi Cloud Key G2 Plus Wall Bracket. This bracket allows you to mount your Cloud Key on a wall, ceiling or flat surface. The bracket is designed to be tight around your cloud key but also has both the top and bottom open to allow for open air cooling of the device. An optional security screw is included to prevent the cloud key from falling out of the wall holder. 

\* Cloud Key is not included. Hardware is included for drywall mounting or mounting into a stud.
