The mount is designed to hold the radar detector and prevent it from shifting while driving while also keeping it at eye level for easy visibility. The newer version of our radar holder features a Rubber pad, creating a non-permanent installation and allows you to easily remove your radar from the screen and stow it when needed. This new rubber pad still provides the same grip to prevent shifting of the radar unit while driving.
