revisions:
  - version: 1.0
    change_log: Initial Prototype of the unit
  - version: 1.1
    change_log: Adjustment made to top and bottom radar holders for better printability. Screws length changed for this part. First unit available for purchase.
  - version: 1.2
    change_log: Moving away from 3M mounting tape in favor of a 3M rubber pad. This new pad still provides grip to the back of the screen but also allows for the radar to be removed and stowed. Upgrade packages will be provided for a short time as we transition from 1.1 -> 1.2. 
  - version: 1.3
    change_log: Newer sturdier packaging and printed color inserts. Parts shipped are unchanged from version 1.2. 
  - version: 1.4
    change_log: Version 1.4 features a new version of our platform that includes a rubber mounting pad integrated into the platform. Radar holder also now comes with a light surface texture applied to enhance the asethetics of the unit. Comes packaged in a new sturdy full color box. 
  - version: 1.5
    change_log: New adjustable platform allows for upward/downward adjustment of the entire radar unit. This should alleviate issues with Tesla screens with varying pitches and fully make this unit compatible with the model S/X. This also allows customers to adjust the upward/downward angle of the radar unit as they see fit. 
  - version: 1.6
    change_log: Adjustable hinge platform is replaced with a new static platform with articulating arm. This should alleviate issues with Tesla screens with varying pitches and fully make this unit compatible with the model S/X. This also allows customers to adjust the upward/downward angle by about 15-20 degrees to match their Tesla. Also provides much better grip on the back of the screen.

The newer version of our radar holder features a Rubber pad, creating a non-permanent installation and allows you to easily remove your radar from the screen and stow it when needed. This new rubber pad still provides the same grip to prevent shifting of the radar unit while driving.
