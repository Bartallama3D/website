revisions:
  - version: 1.0
    change_log: Initial release of the bracket. Packed in plastic bags. 
  - version: 1.1
    change_log: Adjustment to the bracket. Added cable clips to hold radar power cables down the back of the screen. Packaged in cardboard boxes with all required parts.
  - version: 1.2
    change_log: Replaced 3M mounting tape w/a Rubber Pad. Unit installation is no longer permanent and allows for easy stowage of the radar unit. Same great grip as before and does not move while driving. Updated Box to be stronger and better looking w/branding. 
  - version: 1.3
    change_log: Replaced the fat mounting platform with the newer Slim platform found on most other radars. This enhances the aesthetic on the Tesla screen and makes the entire radar looker smaller/slimmer. 
  - version: 1.4
    change_log: Newer sturdier packaging and printed color inserts. Valentine One Gen2 holder has been changed to an Insert/Glove type holder from a tray type holder making the part stronger. The part also has light texture applied to surface to enhance visual appeal, features a satisfying click when inserting the radar unit into the holder, and also supports rotation up to 30 degrees in either direction to support Model S/X vehicles along with custom modded screens that have a tilt attachment added.
